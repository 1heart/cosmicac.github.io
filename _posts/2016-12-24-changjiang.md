We're floating down the Chang Jiang, also know as the Yangtze. It's the longest river in Asia and the third-longest in the world. It's the sixth-largest by discharge volume. It's a big river. We're passing through the Three Gorges area, stopping to visit various places on the way. The destination is just past the Three Gorges dam, which is arguably the largest dam in the world.

First attraction. Shibaozai, built in 1819.

Reached the Three Gorges dam. It's massive. It competes with the Itaipu Dam in Brazil for most energy generated each year. The dam raised the water-level upstream so much that 1.24 million people had to be relocated due to the possibility of their homes being submerged.

Also really cool - the dam has a five stage shiplift.

Downstream view. Wow, it's actually beautiful here. Blue skies, blue water, no haze or smog. Feels almost mediterannean-esque (though I've never been there). Feel like this would be a nice place to live.

Idyllic village in the gorges.
