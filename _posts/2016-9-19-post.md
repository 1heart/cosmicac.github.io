<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>

Learning how to learn is a journey that never ends - it's one of the ultimate metaproblems. Periodically stepping back in the middle of the daily rush to consider my general learning methodology tends pays dividends in all specific instances of learning. A small change on a higher absraction level can propogate down and lead to much greater results on a lower level via the chain rule - so learning how to learn is efficient. Here are some things I've found that help me. 

<h3>ARC 1: ABSTRACTION</h3>
One of the oldest games we first learn to play is the "why" game. Children do it all the time, much to the frustration of adults around them. Why is the water blue? 

// natural tendency to drill down the stack
// not the most efficient method
// at the heart of the matter, abstraction is about managing complexity
// our lives are complicated enough as it is, 
Abstraction is probably the most powerful idea I'll talk about here. Everybody does it on some level, implicitly or consciously.
